Things you should be aware of:
  - Asterisk dialplans are static, not dynamic. In other words, radp generates
    a static dialplan. 

  - You can use any capitalization for Asterisk applications that Asterisk
    would accept, but if you begin an application with a capital letter and the
    application has no arguments, you must include the parentheses. e.g.
    Answer()

  - This is not syntactically correct:

      ext 's' { Answer(); Playback(tt-monkeys); Hangup() }

    You must either use do...end or parenthesize the arguments, as in:

      ext('s') { Answer(); Playback(tt-monkeys); Hangup() }
      ext 's' do Answer(); Playback(tt-monkeys); Hangup(); end

  - Also accepts input on stdin

  - No special processing of arguments is done. In particular, The following
    produce the same output:

      Dial('ZAP/1,30')
      Dial('ZAP/1', 30)
